This suggests that capturing the semantic meaning of words is beneficial for this classification task compared to the simple term frequency approach of TF-IDF.\n",

            "The CNN and LSTM models showed the most significant performance gains. The MLP's performance was limited by the simple 'averaged' embedding approach, as it loses sequential and contextual information. In contrast, the CNN and LSTM models can process the sequence of embeddings directly, which is crucial for understanding sentence structure and context.\n",

            "Are sequential models (LSTM) better suited for this task than CNN/MLP?\n",
            "The LSTM and CNN models both performed well, but for different reasons. The LSTM model, by design, is excellent at understanding long-range dependencies and the sequential nature of text. This can be critical for subtle differences in meaning. The CNN, while not strictly sequential, is highly effective at identifying local patterns and features (like n-grams) which are also very important for text classification. The CNN often has an advantage in computational speed. The MLP, trained on simple averaged embeddings, is the least suited as it fails to capture the rich sequential information present in tweets.\n"
